        <p>Hey! I am in my first semester and am majoring in Web Design and Development.</p>
        <p>I like hiking, camping, going to the gym, and discovering new music and foods.</p>
        <p>I have been married for 3 years to my childhood sweetheart.</p>
        <p>I look forward to learning html and css because it will be important as a front-end developer.</p>
        <p>I have been a member my whole life. My favorite scripture is Heleman 5:12. Jesus is my rock!</p>
        <p>I look forward to working with you this semester!</p>
